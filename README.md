# iFobot
Robot-based Facade Spatial Assembly Optimization 
the iFobot repository consist of grasshopper and rhinocerso files

in order for the repository to work, the following softwares need to be installed: 

Rhinocetros 3D 6.0 a
Rhinoceros WIP
Grasshopper 
Revit 2020 

libraries need to be in installed inside grasshopper environment using "food4rhino" website

-Wallacei 
-KukaPrc 
-weaverbird
-Excel
-Rhinoceros WIP for Revit

after installing all the necessory documents, do the following steps 

clone the reopsiterory at https://github.com/ahmedshingaly/iFobot.git

open the rhinoceros file 
activate grashopper plug in 
open grasshopper file inside the activated GH canvas

you will see the robot arm and the facade module preview in the rhinoceros canvas

double click on wallaceiX to open the generative design engine 
start optimizing to see the robot arm trying to find the best pick and placing solution path with minimum travel distance and free of any colision and singularities. 

please submit any issue if you face an error at any steps of the process. Good luck
